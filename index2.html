            <h2>Benefits of Excell Works Activated Bamboo Charcoal</h2>
            <div class="benefits-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Set of 4 pieces of bamboo charcoal. Each piece is carefully cut and designed to be inserted easily into a pitcher containing city water. 1 piece is good for a personal size water bottle (about 22 oz)</li>
                    <li>2. Simple and effective, the porous surface of the charcoal acts as a purifier that reduces water hardness and absorbs odor for a pure fresh taste. Approximately 3-4 hours of filtering time</li>
                    <li>3. Boil the charcoal in water for 10 minutes once a week to clean. Each stick can last up to 1 to 2 months of use as a water filter. After that, use them as deodorizers or dehumidifiers</li>
                    <li>4. All-natural bamboo charcoal from Jamaica - Dimensions: approximately 1.8 x 3.9 inches each - Size of charcoals may vary</li>
                    <li>5. Do not use with water that is microbiologically unsafe or of unknown quality. Use with tap water only</li>
                    <li>6. Switch to using Excell Bamboo Charcoal Sticks instead of bottled water</li>
                </ul>
